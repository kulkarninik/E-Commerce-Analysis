# E-Commerce-Analysis

I created an e-commerce project using a public dataset to explore consumer behavior and trends. This project allowed me to apply my data analysis skills, gain hands-on experience with data visualization, and uncover valuable insights that can drive business decisions. I'm motivated by the potential to enhance user experiences and optimize sales strategies through data-driven approaches.
